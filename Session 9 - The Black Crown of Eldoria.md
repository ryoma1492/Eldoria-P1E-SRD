## Pre-Text:
The [[Heroes]] have found themselves in [[Lowhaven]] after having survived the [[Crown's Scouring of Lowhaven]] through a magical [[Superweapon]] called [[Peace Ordinance|The Peace Ordinance]] .  Loads of now non-violent [[human-zombie|Zombies]] were destroyed, but some remain.  The [[Curtain splitter]] is currently still functioning normally, despite both the [[Crystal Cultists]] and the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]] both having attempted to stop the splitter once set to function.  [[Lowhaven]] is in a state of temporary calm, with hopeful agriculture and the town praising the [[Heroes]] for cleaning the farmland from the [[black crystals]] with a rotten apple shaped [[cultist magical symbol]]

## Current state
Zombies roaming free, not violent
 - [[Elephant]] included (Gargantuan according to this  https://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/movementPositionAndDistance.htm#bigandLittleCreaturesInCombat:~:text=Big%20and%20Little%20Creatures%20In%20Combat )
City with hole in it
 - Jellybean is mayor
 - Hole is filled with water
Broken Ships and 50 ton magical laser orb in ocean
Splitter wrapped in fortification outside town
Farms getting better
 - rotten apple crystals collected


## Nearby world
Zarthas is angry with us for stealing a splitter and installing it at Lowhaven
