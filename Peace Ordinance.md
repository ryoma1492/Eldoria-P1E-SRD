Type of [[Superweapon]] used by the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]]

Charged with three primary charges of superpowered magic.  These charges happen automatically and with a few seconds (unclear)

#### Charge 1
The first charge (?Red?) uses a legendary [[animate-dead|Animate Dead]]  spell where ALL corpses are raised in a 10 mile radius

#### Charge 2
The second charge (?Green?) causes the raised dead to rush toward the Crystal itself.  Likely a modified mythic [[command-undead|Command Undead]]  ... or closer to the Amalgam ability of [[flytrap-leshy|Flytrap Leshy]]

#### Charge 3
The third charge (?red again... I think?) makes the recalled zombies hostile to the closest life (and much more like a mythic  [[command-undead|Command Undead]] )
