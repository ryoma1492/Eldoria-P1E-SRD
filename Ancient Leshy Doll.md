### DESCRIPTION

This small, hand-stitched rag doll resembles a lotus leshy formed of faded cloth, plant fiber, and pressed petals. Though plainly made, it carries a quiet, patient magic.

Once per week, while holding the Lotus Leshy Rag Doll, the bearer may activate it by maintaining 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration. If this concentration is broken for any reason, the activation fails and the weekly use is expended.

Upon successful activation, the Lotus Leshy Rag Doll casts plant growth, except that the Enrichment option is replaced with the following effect.

Enrichment (Modified): This effect targets planted, non-magical vegetation within a 200-foot radius that is capable of surviving unaided in its environment. All such plants immediately mature any existing fruit, grain, nuts, or seeds they are capable of producing at that time.  
A given plant or planting area cannot benefit from this effect more than once per month.

During the course of concentrating on the doll, it grows warm and faintly fragrant.  Nearby plants subtly lean toward it as the effect takes hold.

The Lotus Leshy Rag Doll is not designed for battle, and creatures attempting to use it amid chaos or violence often find its magic unresponsive.
