## Pre-Text
With the [[Curtain Splitter]] active and [[Lowhaven]] bathed in true sunlight for the first time in a century, the [[Heroes]] turned their attention to lingering corruption beneath the land itself. Though the fog had retreated, something still poisoned the soil — a quieter rot tied to the same forces as the [[Crystal Cultists]] and their strange [[black crystals]].

## Current State
Lowhaven farms recovering unevenly  
- Some fields flourishing
- Others remain barren and blighted  

Cult activity suspected beneath farmland  
Curtain Splitter remains operational but vulnerable  

## Act 1 - The Marked Fields
In the aftermath of the cultist assault on the Splitter, [[Gargon]] quietly looted the fallen. Among scorched robes and ash, he recovered a half-burned map marked with crude X’s. [[Rhett]] and [[Carls Jr.]] recognized the marks as farms surrounding Lowhaven — places where crops had failed long before the fog lifted.

Following the map led the party to buried geometric crystals beneath the soil. Each crystal bore a rotten apple sigil rather than the ladder rune used by the cultists. When removed, the land above healed almost instantly. The farmers watched in disbelief as dead fields turned fertile once more.

At one such site, the party uncovered a satchel containing an ornate key marked with the crest of the [[Wicklow Estate]].

## Act 2 - The Wicklow Estate
Locals spoke in hushed tones of the Wicklows — once prosperous, ruined after the disappearance of [[----- Whicklow]] ten years prior. The estate itself stood abandoned, iron gates rusted and vines claiming the walls.

Most of the party entered normally. [[Carls Jr.]] attempted to scale the gate repeatedly, failing spectacularly under the judgmental gaze of his wolf, [[Cheeburger Cheeburger]]. Inside, dust and silence ruled. A stash of aged wine was discovered, and Carls consumed an entire bottle to restore his honor. It worked.

In the barn, a trapdoor led twenty feet down into a mud-filled chamber. A torch tied to a rope raised suspicion — wisely extinguished just before [[Rhett]] triggered a hidden bear trap.

## Act 3 - Beneath the Farm
Below, the party discovered cultists gambling around a table. [[Atticus]] bluffed his way into the game, intentionally losing coin while learning that one of the men was a missing local farmer, presumed dead for months.

Violence followed. The cultists were defeated, battered and bloodied. Two survivors begged for mercy and revealed the truth: they served a being called *the [[dreamer]]*, deeper below.

## Act 4 - The Dreamer
Guided by deception and bravado, the party was allowed passage deeper underground. The tunnel narrowed until crawling was required, opening at last into a vast organic chamber — ribbed with roots like the inside of a chest cavity.

At its center lay the Dreamer, a man fused to the earth by living roots. His voice echoed through the chamber itself.

> “I smell the Ascendant One upon you. Does he know what he’s becoming?”

When combat began, the room fought alongside him. Roots lashed, acid bled from wounds, and the walls convulsed with each strike. [[Carls Jr.]] and [[Rhett]] peppered the figure from range while [[Gargon]] and [[Atticus]] burned away the living barriers.

Near death, [[Leon]] surged forward and delivered a fatal [[Shocking Grasp]]. The chamber erupted in crackling energy, nearly killing both Leon and Gargon as the [[Dreamer]] died.

## Act 5 - Aftermath
As the roots withered and the earth stilled, the oppressive presence beneath Lowhaven vanished. The party emerged battered but victorious. With the Dreamer slain, the farmland corruption ceased entirely.

For the first time since the fog’s arrival, [[Lowhaven]]’s sunlight was truly its own.

## Consequences
- [[Lowhaven]] farmland fully restored
- The rotten-apple [[black crystals]] neutralized
- Cult infrastructure beneath the town destroyed
- Unknown connection between the [[Dreamer]] and the [[Ascendant One]] revealed
