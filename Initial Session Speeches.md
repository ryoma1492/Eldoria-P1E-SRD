## Prologue I – _“The Quiet Before the Thinning”_

_(Lightly ominous, wide scope, enticing)_

Long before your first step upon the [[Mosslight Path]],  
before the breath of your [[Grizzly Companion]] steamed in morning air,  
before flame ever answered your whisper at the [[Emberstone Shrine]]…

…the world was older.

And softer.

There was a time when the forests of [[Evershade Forest]] were not borders on maps,  
not timber to be measured,  
nor territories to be carved and claimed.

They were simply… _alive_.

The great trees spoke in leaf-rustle and root-creak.  
Rivers ran clear enough to mirror the stars.  
Predator and prey moved in a dance older than memory —  
neither cruel nor kind, only balanced.

In those days, the people of [[Leaf Haven]] did not guard the forest.

They belonged to it.

And it belonged to nothing.

Yet beyond the green hush of the canopy,  
beyond the mosslit trails and the singing brookstones,  
the world has begun to thin.

Rumors travel on merchant carts and tired horses.

Cities where smoke never clears.  
Kings who measure land by coin and conquest.  
Hunters who no longer ask permission of the wild before loosing arrow.

No war has come to [[Leaf Haven]].

No army marches beneath its boughs.

But sometimes — in the deepest hours before dawn —  
the forest grows still.

Too still.

The birds hold their breath.

The insects cease their song.

And somewhere, far beyond sight…

a blade bites into bark.

A mark is carved.

And something ancient and patient begins to watch.

## Prologue II – _“The Last Gentle Place”_

_(Emphasizes Thornbriar Hollow as a sanctuary — peaceful, luminous, worth defending)_

There are places in the world where the wind smells of smoke and iron.

Places where walls rise higher than trees,  
where coin speaks louder than wisdom,  
and where the earth is something to be owned.

But not here.

Here, in [[Leaf Haven]], the dawn filters through silver leaves  
and paints the forest floor in shifting gold.

Here, the [[Great Willow]] bends but never breaks,  
its roots deep as memory and its branches wide as welcome.

Here, flame is not destruction —  
it is warmth,  
it is hearth,  
it is the sacred light tended at the [[Emberstone Shrine]].

Here, a young [[Forest Guide of Thornbriar Hollow|Guide]] can walk a trail blindfolded  
and still know each root by memory.

Here, a wandering human druid can kneel beside a wounded fawn  
and find that the forest does not reject him —  
it listens.

The people of this village do not rule the trees.

They ask.

They learn.

They tend.

And the forest answers in kind.

Beyond these woods, the world may be shifting.  
Rumors may darken.  
Edges may sharpen.

But within the embrace of [[Evershade Forest]],  
peace still breathes.

The moss still glows.  
The streams still sing.  
The balance still holds.

And if there is anywhere left in the wide turning world  
where harmony has not yet been broken—

It is here.

It is now.

It is yours.
