#### Theoretical homebrew (UNUSED)
 - Legendary [[locate-object|Locate Object]] magical item
	 - Object type (pick one)
		 - Wand (3 total uses)
			 - Gamble due to limited uses
			 - Allows an easy (low complexity) One Shot Campaign with [[Leon]]
		 - Compass (1/person)
			 - acts like Limited Wish
				 - it attunes the compass to 
					 - switch "N" to point to the object at all times
					 - spin when location indeterminate (due to [[locate-object|Locate Object]] rules)
	 - Legendary due to Range (it's infinite)

 - Stormlure - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/r-z/stormlure

 - Dowsing Syrup - https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/c-d/dowsing-syrup
	 - Reason - Canon way to give direction to a find person without the spell
