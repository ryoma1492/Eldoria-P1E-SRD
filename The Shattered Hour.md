## Core Theme
Cycle broken.

Decay denied.
Winter postponed.
Death postponed.

Time manipulated in pursuit of perfection.

## Faction Head
[[The Veiled Chronarch]]

True identity unknown.

Speaks in layered echoes.
Refers to events that have not yet occurred.

---

## Philosophy
The natural cycle is flawed.

- Decay is waste.
- Death is preventable.
- Entropy is inefficiency.
- Time can be corrected.

They do not destroy forests.

They freeze them.

---

## Manifestations
- Glades locked in perpetual autumn
- Creatures caught mid-motion
- Areas where wounds reopen
- Places where aging accelerates unnaturally

Without decay:
Soil weakens.
Seeds fail.
Balance collapses silently.

---

## Signature Ability Concept

### Temporal Rejection
- Undo last round of damage (1/combat)
- Force reroll of successful action
- Accelerate plant growth violently
- Reverse minor events within limited radius

Visual:
Light fractures.
Sound echoes twice.
Shadows move independently.

---

## Notable Generals

### [[The Hourbound Arbiter]]
- Enforces localized time loops
- Traps enemies in repeating actions
- Obsessed with preventing "avoidable mistakes"

Motivation: Correction of imperfection.

---

### [[Archivist Selenth]]
- Collects "moments of significance"
- Preserves them in crystalline stasis
- Studies branching possibilities

Motivation: Understanding doomed timelines.

---

## Philosophical Opposition to [[Druidic Circles]]
- Decay is sacred in druidic belief
- Death feeds soil
- Winter is necessary

The Chronarch denies winter.

---

## Relationship to Other Factions
- Sees [[The Devouring Crown]] as short-sighted
- Sees [[The Iron Concordance]] as brittle
- Believes all timelines without intervention end in collapse
