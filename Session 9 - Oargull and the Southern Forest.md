## Pre-Text:
The [[Heroes]] have found themselves in [[Lowhaven]] after surviving the [[Crown's Scouring of Lowhaven]] through the activation of a magical [[Superweapon]] known as the [[Peace Ordinance|Peace Ordinance]]. The ordinance neutralized the majority of hostile undead, though many [[human-zombie|Zombies]] remain animate and non-violent.

The [[Curtain splitter]] continues to function normally, despite interference attempts by both the [[Crystal Cultists]] and the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]]. [[Lowhaven]] has entered a fragile calm: farmland once corrupted by [[black crystals]] is being restored, and the town openly praises the [[Heroes]] for cleansing the soil of a rotten-apple-shaped [[cultist magical symbol]] embedded throughout the fields.

This peace is provisional.

## Current state
- Zombies roam freely but exhibit no aggression
  - Includes a reanimated [[Elephant]] (Gargantuan; see movement scale reference)
- City damage remains severe
  - Jellybean has been appointed acting mayor
  - A massive breach in the city has flooded, forming a water-filled crater
- Broken ships and a 50-ton magical laser orb remain submerged offshore
- The splitter has been relocated and fortified outside the city
- Agricultural recovery is underway
  - Rotten apple crystals have been collected and neutralized

## Nearby world
- [[Zarthas]] is openly hostile toward the party for stealing and activating a splitter
- Rumors of cultist activity persist beyond Lowhaven
- [[MyDrider]] (unconfirmed sightings)

# Leg One – Meet the Pirate Posse

Four roguishly dressed travelers approach Lowhaven from the west on foot. They are cautious but not hostile, and make no effort to conceal their identities.

1. **Person 1 – Leader**
   - Name: [[Mallard Fleetfin]]
   - Class: Human Rogue 7
   - Motivation: A growing undead problem and a darker threat afflicting his home
2. **Person 2 – Posse Member**
   - Name: MacKenson (“Jaggery”)
   - Role: Businessman and smooth negotiator
3. **Person 3 – Posse Member**
   - Name: Alaria (“Soylent”) Fleetfin
   - Role: Mallard’s wife and trusted second

Mallard explains that their home, [[Oargull]], has been plagued by strange creatures arriving nightly. These attacks began shortly after the Peace Ordinance was activated, though the pirates do not yet understand the connection.

They offer the party a **Pirate Accord**: a serpentstone miniature oar that chirps like a seagull when lightly struck. Possession of this token guarantees safe passage and trade among the seven pirate towns that honor the pirate code.

Additional incentives include:
- Access to Oargull’s dry dock for large-scale ship repairs at a 15% discount
- Willingness to assist with ocean salvage, including retrieval of sunken ships and large artifacts (including magical laser spheres)

**Unspoken truth:**  
Oargull’s defenses are failing. Workers, sailors, and even children have been lost to the nightly attacks. The creatures show a disturbing preference for artifacts predating the town’s current settlement.

# Leg Two – Pirate Town and Nighttime Harassment

The party travels to [[Oargull]]. Upon arrival, Mallard warns:

> “Dusk’s four hours off for you. For the town, it comes quicker.”

### Notable locations in Oargull

1. **Massive Brewery**
   - Owned by Mallard Fleetfin
   - Primary export: rum and barley beer
   - Formerly part of **Port Malone College of the Arts**
   - Once considered a center of philosophy and learning in a more peaceful age
   - If searched (Leon): remnants of lecture halls and academic offices remain

2. **Soccer Field**
   - Vestige of the college’s heyday
   - Now used for goat grazing
   - Original field markings remain faintly pressed into the grass

3. **Bar**
   - Sells local brews and imported kegs
   - Notable drink: Razor Ridge Stout (“Stone Splitting Headache”)

4. **Pirate Market**
   - Foreign goods and extravagant spoils
   - Useful magic items commonly available (bags of holding, robes of useful items)

5. **Dry Dock**
6. **Massive Trading Cog**
   - Square-rigged, crewed by 20–30
   - Casino operates in the ship’s hold
7. **Residential District**
8. **Fishery**

### Nightfall Event

At dusk, screams erupt from the residential areas.

- Two **Dire Bats** attack, attempting to steal:
  - Artifacts from before the town’s founding (college textbooks, relics)
  - Meat of any kind they can carry
- A third, smaller bat escapes toward an abandoned house

The abandoned house:
- Feels haunted
- Contains the bones of **Elen** and **Deitha**
- Deitha wears a rose-colored brooch

**Flavor:**  
This has occurred every night for the past three days.

# Leg Three – The Webbed Forest

South of [[Oargull]] lies a forest that no longer behaves like a forest.

The trees are bound together with thick, wrist-wide cords of spider silk, stretched deliberately between trunks and branches. The webbing forms corridors, thresholds, and chambers, as though the forest itself has been reorganized into rooms. Movement off these paths is difficult, loud, and resisted by the silk.

Sound is muted here. Screams do not carry.

## The Lake of the Keeper

The first clearing opens onto a serene lake, unnaturally still. At its center floats a single lily pad bearing a white flower. No other vegetation touches the water’s surface.

Characters with keen perception (Carls Jr. especially) notice:
- The lily pad does not drift
- The flower turns subtly toward movement
- The webbing avoids the water entirely

When approached, the lily pad and flower animate and rise, reshaping into a humanoid plant creature — a [[Leshy]] who identifies himself as the original keeper of this forest.

He recognizes a **Lotus Leshy Rag Doll** recovered from the bats and explains that it was made long ago by a gentle child. He speaks calmly, but with quiet grief.

The leshy claims:
- The forest once welcomed thought, silence, and study
- A “foreigner who claimed to love reason” arrived and lied to him
- The spiders are not native, and their presence has corrupted the forest’s purpose

He asks the [[Heroes]] to cleanse the forest of:
- The spiders
- The one who brought them

He gestures toward an opening in the webbing beyond the lake.

## The Classroom Clearing

Beyond the lake lies a grotesque imitation of a lecture hall. Stone and wood have been dragged into place, desks arranged in rows. Corpses — some ancient, some recent — are tightly webbed into chairs, forced upright like students.

Each cadaver holds writing implements or exam sheets.

A chalkboard bears logical statements and syllogisms written and rewritten, some correct, some subtly broken.

This is a testing chamber.

The “students” animate only enough to turn pages or nod. They are not hostile unless disturbed.

### The Examination

To proceed safely, the party must:
- Answer or interpret the logical problems correctly
- Or convincingly pretend to be members of the original class roll

Success:
- Frees most of the bound cadavers
- Allows recovery of their belongings
- Opens the webbed passage forward

Failure or tampering:
- Causes a “student” to collapse into acidic sludge, destroying its contents

A scratching voice, aware of the party’s success, speaks from deeper within the forest:
> “You have passed. Come forward.”

## The Drider’s Hall

The next chamber opens vertically. Webbing climbs the walls and ceiling, forming a vaulted space. Magical darkness clings to the upper reaches.

This is the domain of [[MyDrider]].

The drider:
- Moves freely along ceiling webs
- Uses magical darkness to obscure itself
- Has outfitted lesser spiders with objects imbued with shadow

Combat here is disorienting and vertical. Lightning and darkness are used to break cohesion.

At the rear of the chamber rests:
- A massive **ogre spider**, unnaturally still
- A webbed **cocoon**, intact and pulsing faintly

## The Cocoon

Damaging the cocoon reveals a living humanoid within.

When the drider is slain, the ogre spider’s behavior changes erratically. If the cocoon is freed, the spider flees deeper into the forest, abandoning its charge.

The cocooned figure is revealed to be [[Althric Vale]].

## Althric Vale

Althric is weak but lucid. He speaks haltingly, with clarity breaking through long periods of fixation.

He reveals:
- He was once a professor at **Port Malone College**
- He was contacted by thinkers who promised greater awareness
- He agreed to become something more — a “Dreamer”
- He does not know what caused the catastrophe that killed the town

He denies responsibility, but does not deny participation.

With gentle conversation (Leon especially), Althric comes to accept that his wife and daughter are dead. As this realization settles, his strength fades.

Althric dies at peace.

## Resolution

With the spiders driven out and the foreign influence broken, the forest begins to loosen. The webbing slackens. Sound returns.

The [[Leshy]] reappears, thanking the party. He vows to restore the forest as closely as possible to what it once was.

He asks for the **Lotus Leshy Rag Doll** and, in gratitude, imbues it with a portion of his power before departing.

The forest remains changed — but no longer hostile.

Some truths, once tested, do not need to be repeated.
