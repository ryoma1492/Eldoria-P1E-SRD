## Core Theme
Order without mercy.

Hierarchy as perfection.
Control as virtue.
Structure above instinct.

## Faction Head
[[Arch-Marshal Seredain]]

Former holy knight turned architect of civilization.

Belief:
Freedom breeds chaos.
Chaos breeds suffering.
Suffering must be engineered away.

---

## Philosophy
- Wild magic is dangerous
- Druids are irresponsible
- Forests must be mapped and regulated
- Predators must be culled
- Spirits must be cataloged or bound

They do not consider themselves villains.

They consider themselves necessary.

---

## Signature Ability Concept

### Edict of Stillness
Within a controlled radius:

- Suppresses summoned creatures
- Reduces Wild Shape duration
- Dampens natural terrain bonuses
- Forces morale checks for animal companions
- Temporarily negates difficult terrain caused by plant growth

Visual:
Air grows heavy.
Sound dampens.
Wind halts.

## Notable Generals

### [[Commander Halveth Ironroot]]
- Tactical genius
- Establishes fortified forest outposts
- Replaces groves with watchtowers
- Specializes in anti-beast tactics

Motivation: Stability through dominance.

---

### [[Inquisitor Valeen of the Measured Word]]
- Anti-primal magic specialist
- Catalogs spirits and magical anomalies
- Seeks to bind or neutralize uncontrolled entities

Motivation: Documentation and containment.

---

## Philosophical Opposition to [[Druidic Circles]]
- Nature must be governed
- Balance is inefficient without oversight
- Autonomy leads to entropy

---

## Relationship to Other Factions
- Views [[The Devouring Crown]] as wasteful but legitimate
- Sees [[The Shattered Hour]] as heretical destabilizers
- Believes all three will eventually require unification under law
