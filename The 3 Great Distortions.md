Three forces pull at the balance of the world:

1. [[The Devouring Crown]] – Consumption without limit
2. [[The Iron Concordance]] – Order without mercy
3. [[The Shattered Hour]] – Cycle without decay

Each opposes the philosophy of [[Druidic Circles]] in a different way.

Where druids seek:
- Balance
- Stewardship
- Natural cycles

These factions enforce:
- Extraction
- Domination
- Manipulation

They are not allied.

But their existence reshapes the world.

And the forest has begun to notice.
