## Core Belief
Balance is weakness.
Dominance is truth.
The forest must be hardened.

## Background
Once walked among druidic circles (possibly even studied near [[Thornbriar Hollow]]).

He rejected:
- Communal stewardship
- Shared territory
- Gentle intervention

He embraced:
- Predation as law
- Strength as morality
- Ownership as necessity

He claims a portion of [[Evershade Forest]] as personal domain.

## Visual Presence
- Wild hair tangled with bone trinkets
- Antler fragments woven into cloak
- Eyes intense and sleepless
- Carries multiple hunting tools
- Smiles rarely, but when he does it is sharp

## Methods
- Drives prey strategically
- Funnels movement with cut brush
- Sets snares in geometric patterns
- Observes patrol patterns
- Carves territorial sigils

## Sigil
[[Territorial Mark – Stag Skull Sigil]]

Below it, carved in Common:
"Claimed."
