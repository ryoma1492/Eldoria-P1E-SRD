*Settlement / Eldorian Town*

## Overview
Lowhaven is a small agricultural town located in the former plains of [[Eldoria]]. Once prosperous, it fell into severe decline after the rise of the [[Fool's Curtain]], as diminished sunlight and excessive rainfall turned surrounding farmland into bog and rot.

For decades, Lowhaven survived on the brink of collapse.

## Geography
- Situated amid reclaimed farmland
- Surrounded by former estates and rural holdings
- Nearby marshlands encroach on older fields

## The Farmland
Lowhaven’s survival depends on its surrounding farms.

Key features:
- Deep soil, once fertile but long blighted
- Subterranean corruption tied to [[black crystals]]
- Multiple family estates, including the abandoned [[Wicklow Estate]]

Following recent events, much of the farmland has been restored, though its stability depends on continued access to sunlight.

## The Curtain Splitter
Lowhaven is uniquely dependent on the [[Curtain Splitter]].

Effects:
- Forced back the fog surrounding the town
- Restored true sunlight for the first time in a century
- Revived agriculture almost immediately

Without the Splitter, the town’s recovery would collapse within weeks.

## Governance
Lowhaven traditionally maintained a simple civic structure.

- **Mayor:** [[Jellybean]] (current)
- **Guard Captain:** [[Levi]]
- Civil authority is informal and community-driven

Recent crises have strained these systems severely.

## The Scouring
Lowhaven was the site of a devastating Crown military action following the installation of the [[Curtain Splitter]].  In this event, the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]] utilized both the [[Sunlance Crystal]] and the [[Peace Ordinance]]

The event resulted in:
- Destruction of the northern quarter
- Massive civilian casualties
- A flooded crater where homes once stood
- Ongoing presence of non-aggressive undead

The long-term political and social consequences remain unresolved.

## Current Conditions
- Portions of the town lie in ruins
- Farms are productive but vulnerable
- Undead roam freely but pose little threat
- Fortifications surround the [[Curtain Splitter]]

Despite this, morale remains cautiously hopeful.

## Reputation
Lowhaven is increasingly viewed as:
- A symbol of defiance against the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]]
- Proof that the fog can be pushed back
- A dangerous precedent

Travelers speak its name with equal parts awe and fear.
