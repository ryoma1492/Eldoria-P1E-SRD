## Pre-Text:

[[Initial Session Speeches]]

The [[YoungHeroes]] are young druids of [[Leaf Haven]], an elven forest village nestled within the ancient canopy of the [[Evershade Forest]]. One serves as a [[Forest Guide of Thornbriar Hollow|Guide]], walking the known trails with confidence. The other studies the primal flame at the [[Emberstone Shrine]].

Recently, subtle wrongness has entered the forest.

Game trails feel redirected.
Moss is disturbed in deliberate lines.
Birdsong ceases in certain stretches of wood.

The forest does not cry out.

It watches.

Unbeknownst to the village, a human tracker — referred to locally as [[# Thalin the Forest Master]] — has claimed a portion of the forest as his own territory. He has marked it, shaped it, and begun enforcing his philosophy of dominion over balance.

The elves do not believe land can be owned.

He does.

This difference will draw blood.

## Current State
- [[Leaf Haven]] remains unaware of open threat
- The [[Great Willow]] shows faint discoloration in its sap
- Subtle territorial marks have appeared in outer hunting grounds
- Animal behavior has shifted:
  - Deer move in unnatural straight paths
  - Wolves avoid certain ridgelines
  - Ravens linger longer than normal
- The [[Forest Guide of Thornbriar Hollow|Guide]] senses disruption along her usual patrol routes
- The [[Grizzly Companion]] has become more alert at trail intersections

## Nearby World
- Human settlements beyond the forest edge continue controlled logging
- Rumors of trappers vanishing along the [[South Mosslight Path]]
- A reclusive hunter known as [[# Thalin the Forest Master]] has not traded in months
- Whispers of deeper forest corruption (future arc: [[The Spreading Blight]])

# Leg One – The Stag on the Guide’s Trail

The [[Forest Guide of Thornbriar Hollow|Guide]] discovers a dead stag along her personal patrol route on the [[Mosslight Path]].

The location matters:
- This is her trail.
- She knows its rhythms.
- She has walked it dozens of times.

### The Dead Stag

- Killed by a single precise arrow
- Not butchered
- Not eaten
- Positioned facing down-trail
- No predator scent nearby

Hoofprints reveal:
- The stag was driven in a controlled line
- Brush cut strategically to funnel movement
- No sign of panic scatter

A tree nearby bears a carved symbol:

[[Territorial Mark – Stag Skull Sigil]]

Below it, in Common:
> “Claimed.”

This is the first philosophical wound.

### Signs of Surveillance

If the [[YoungHeroes]] investigate:

- Slightly disturbed moss patches with clear line of sight to the trail
- A faint bootprint overlapping the Guide’s from a previous day
- A snapped twig several moments after they pass
- The distant scent of cold ash

The sense emerges:

They are not alone.

### Encounter: The Snare Field

Along the return route:
- Two wolves caught in wire snares
- One panicked, one exhausted

Choices:
- Free them (risk bite)
- Kill them
- Track the snare pattern

This introduces:
- The precision of [[# Thalin the Forest Master]]
- His systematic reshaping of territory

No direct confrontation yet.

He observes.

# Leg Two – Boundaries Enforced

Escalation begins.

The forest reacts more visibly.

### Trail Interference

The Guide notices:
- Her subtle trail markers rearranged
- A blaze mark cut over one of hers
- New path diversions carved into undergrowth

The message is clear:

Someone is correcting her.

### Village Tension

At [[Leaf Haven]]:

- [[Lira Softstep]] reports seeing “a man who walks like he owns the trees.”
- [[Elder Faelion]] dismisses early concerns but asks the [[YoungHeroes]] to investigate quietly.
- The flame at [[Emberstone Shrine]] flickers strangely when speaking of the outer woods.

A trapper from the forest edge is found dead:
- Single arrow wound
- Gear intact
- No theft

This confirms escalation.

### Encounter: Testing Shot

While tracking beyond known paths:

- An arrow strikes a tree near the Bear.
- A trained hunting dog charges briefly, then retreats.
- A distant voice calls out:

> “Turn back.”

[[# Thalin the Forest Master]] does not intend to kill yet.

He intends to warn.

He uses:
- Cover
- Elevated position
- Pre-set escape route

He withdraws after 1–2 rounds.

He has measured them now.

# Leg Three – The Claim and the Reckoning

The [[YoungHeroes]] track [[# Thalin the Forest Master]] into his claimed territory.

This area feels different.

## The Claimed Grove

Trees marked in a perimeter ring.
Game trails rerouted inward.
Deadfall traps placed to funnel movement.

Animal carcasses hang, partially preserved.

A rough wooden platform blind sits elevated between three trees.

Below it:

A circle cleared deliberately.

Ownership manifested physically.

## Final Confrontation

[[# Thalin the Forest Master]]
- Human Ranger 2 (or Ranger 1 / Fighter 1 depending on balance needs)
- Favored Terrain: Forest
- Trained Hunting Dog
- Masterwork Longbow
- 2 snares pre-set
- 1 concealed pit trap

Tactics:
- Fires from elevation
- Targets spellcaster first
- Attempts to separate Bear from party
- Retreats if reduced below half HP (optional recurring villain)

Philosophy (during confrontation):

> “You walk it. I shape it.”
> “Balance is decided by the one strong enough to enforce it.”
> “You protect weakness. I remove it.”

If captured:
He demands they recognize his boundary.

If killed:
His journal remains.

## Loot

- Masterwork Longbow
- Hunter’s Journal ([[trackerVillain’s Field Notes]])
- 2 Potions of Cure Light Wounds
- 1 Feather Token (Tree)
- Detailed map marking future regions (seed for [[The Spreading Blight]])

## trackerVillain’s Field Notes

Contains:
- Notes on the Guide’s patrol schedule
- Observations on bear behavior
- Sketch of fungal growth deeper in forest
- Mention of “rot spreading under bark”
- Reference to something watching him as well

He was not the only intruder.

# Resolution

Returning to [[Leaf Haven]]:

- The village must decide whether to:
  - Burn his blind
  - Leave it as warning
  - Repurpose it as watch post

The [[Great Willow]]’s sap lightens slightly.

The wolves return to normal paths.

The forest exhales.

But deeper within [[Evershade Forest]]:

Something else moves.

If you wish next, I can:

- Write a mechanically balanced stat block for [[# Thalin the Forest Master]]
- Flesh out [[Leaf Haven]] with districts, minor NPCs, and political factions
- Create a “Forest Event Table” for ambient realism
- Or outline Leg Four expanding the hinted corruption

The roots are down.

Where shall we let them grow? 🌲
