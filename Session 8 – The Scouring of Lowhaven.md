## Pre-Text
With the [[Curtain Splitter]] active and [[Lowhaven]] bathed in sunlight for the first time in a century, hope briefly took root. Crops recovered, spirits lifted, and the [[Heroes]] were hailed as saviors. That hope lasted less than a day.

At dawn, the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]] arrived.

## Current State (At Session Start)
Curtain Splitter active and unfortified  
Lowhaven partially recovered but defenseless  
Crown hostility expected but timing unknown

## Act I – The Crown Arrives

The morning bell rang in panic. Three Crown warships anchored offshore, their banners unmistakable. [[Jellybean]] rushed through the streets as citizens fled. The halfling mayor, wearing his towering top hat labeled “MAYOR,” collided with him in the square, shoved the hat into Jellybean’s arms, and fled the city.

“You caused this. You’re the mayor now. Fix it!”

With moments to spare, Jellybean began organizing what defenses he could — ballistas dragged into position, watch posts manned, and [[Nibwick]] armed with flasks of alchemical fire under strict instructions to wait for orders.

A diplomatic envoy arrived, led by [[Caldus]], a sincere and disciplined Crown paladin. His demands were precise:
- Immediate surrender of the [[Curtain Splitter]]
- Arrest and transfer of [[Finn]] and [[Atticus]]

Tension hung heavy as negotiations began.

They ended abruptly when Nibwick hurled alchemical fire onto one of the Crown ships.

## Act II – The Sunlance Fires

The Crown responded without hesitation.

A blinding beam erupted from a focusing array aboard one of the ships — the [[Sunlance Crystal]]. The blast scoured the northern quarter of Lowhaven in an instant. Stone vaporized. Homes vanished. Hundreds died before they could scream.

As chaos spread through the streets, [[Levi]], captain of the guard, brought dire news to Jellybean:

1. The Sunlance was charging to fire again  
2. A massive [[Elephant]] siege creature had been deployed and was advancing on the Splitter  
3. The Temple roof had collapsed, trapping civilians  

The party split.

## Act III – The Sunlance Sabotage

[[Leon]], [[Gargon]], and [[Caleb]] made for the Crown flagship. Gargon dove into the water to swim beneath the hull. Leon and Caleb approached via the gangplank and were met by twelve Crown soldiers.

Caleb attempted diplomacy. It failed immediately.

Leon leapt into the sea and followed Gargon. Caleb, badly beaten, threw himself after them and sank out of sight.

Climbing the hull, Leon reached the top deck unseen. At the moment the Sunlance fired again, he hurled a pair of goggles into the focusing nozzle. The beam discharged wildly, shearing off the rear third of the ship and obliterating one of the other Crown vessels entirely.

Both Leon and Gargon escaped the blast unharmed.

## Act IV – The Siege Beast

Within the city, [[Finn]], [[Atticus]], and Jellybean worked frantically to repair ballistas as the elephantine siege creature advanced on the [[Curtain Splitter]]. Their efforts drew the attention of Crown-trained [[Worg]]s.

A brutal tower fight followed. Jellybean was nearly killed. Despite this, the defenders succeeded — slaying the worgs and bringing down the massive creature before it could reach the Splitter.

Lowhaven still stood.

## Act V – Killian Unleashed

As the fighting ebbed, Caleb returned to the streets and encountered [[Captain Killian]] amid a pile of more than thirty dead Crown soldiers.

Killian appeared changed — taller, slitted pupils, a strange haze in his eyes. He claimed he had acted to protect civilians trapped in the Temple collapse.

Whether that was the full truth remained unclear.

## Act VI – The Peace Ordinance

The Crown fleet began to withdraw.

As Lowhaven celebrated its survival, one remaining ship launched a metallic sphere high into the air. It landed in the smoking crater of the northern district and began to pulse with green light.

Every corpse in the city — Crown soldier and civilian alike — rose and sprinted toward the device. Some fused into a writhing mass around it. Moments later, the light turned red.

The undead attacked.

[[Leon]] and [[Atticus]] were seized and dragged into the mass. [[Caleb]] and [[Gargon]] blasted holy energy into the fused undead while Finn hurled hammers, cracking the sphere. Seeing an opening, Finn charged and split the device in half.

Instantly, the undead lost all aggression, becoming mindless husks.

Engraved on the surface of the shattered orb were the words:

> **“Peace Ordinance — Authorized by Order of King Balfour IV.”**

## Conclusion – Aftermath

Lowhaven survived — but forever changed.

The northern quarter was gone, replaced by a flooded crater. Pacified undead wandered the streets. The Curtain Splitter still stood, wrapped now in desperate fortifications. The people praised the [[Heroes]], but fear lay beneath every cheer.

The Crown had shown its hand.

And peace, it seemed, was enforced at any cost.

## Consequences
- [[Lowhaven]] partially destroyed
- First confirmed Crown use of the [[Peace Ordinance]]
- [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]] exposed as willing to annihilate civilians
- Jellybean installed as mayor
- Pacified undead roaming the city
