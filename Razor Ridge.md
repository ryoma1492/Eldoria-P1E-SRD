*Settlement / Crown City*

## Overview
Razor Ridge is a massive vertical settlement located in [[Atheria]], built around a towering stone-and-fungus spire that rises from a subterranean lake. Once a minor mining hub, it grew rapidly into a dense industrial city supplying ore, labor, and arcane materials to the [[Royal Crown of Eldoria]].

It is best known in recent history for a catastrophic Crown military action that reshaped both the city and the political landscape of Emberfall.

## Geography & Structure
- Constructed as a spiraling city carved into a colossal ridge
- Bioluminescent fungi provide most ambient light
- Accessed via subterranean waterways and massive lifts
- The **Crown Top** forms the highest and most privileged district

The lower levels are crowded, dim, and home to miners and laborers, while the upper spire houses Crown officials and secured facilities.

## Society
Razor Ridge is defined by extreme social stratification.

- **Lower Districts:** Miners, dockworkers, craftsmen, and families
- **Upper Districts:** Crown officials, military officers, researchers
- Heavy Crown presence and surveillance throughout the city

Despite this, Razor Ridge fostered strong communal ties among workers, particularly in taverns such as [[The Copper Keg]].

## Halbrin the Magus
Razor Ridge was the place of retirement for [[Halbrin]], a former Crown magus and mentor to [[Zarthus]]. By the time of the party’s arrival, Halbrin lived under the supervision of a Crown-affiliated caretaker and appeared mentally diminished.

Subsequent investigation revealed that Halbrin was being chemically suppressed through daily herbal dosing. Once freed, he confirmed long-held suspicions regarding Crown secrecy, arcane weapons, and Splitter technology.

## The Riot and the Blast
Following Halbrin’s rescue, unrest in Razor Ridge escalated into open rebellion. Miners and laborers clashed with Crown guards, sparked in part by speeches made within [[The Copper Keg]] and the death of the miner [[Frye]].

As the riot reached the Crown Top, the Crown responded with overwhelming force.

A devastating energy blast — later confirmed to match the effects of the [[Sunlance Crystal]] — struck the upper spire. The attack:
- Killed thousands instantly
- Sheared off half of the Crown Top
- Sent massive sections of the city collapsing into the lake below

The blast ended the uprising, but at catastrophic cost.

## Aftermath
- Razor Ridge suffered irreparable structural damage
- Thousands were killed, many uncounted
- Crown authority was reasserted through fear
- News of the event was heavily restricted

Survivors quietly refer to the event as a massacre rather than a suppression.

## Political Significance
Razor Ridge represents:
- The first widely witnessed use of a [[Royal Crown of Eldoria|Crown]] [[superweapon]] against its own citizens
- Proof that rebellion would be met with annihilation
- A turning point for dissident movements across Emberfall

The destruction of Razor Ridge is frequently cited in connection with later events in [[Lowhaven]].

## Reputation
Among Crown loyalists, Razor Ridge is a tragic necessity — a reminder of the dangers of unrest.

Among laborers, Fogborn, and rebels, it is a warning carved in stone and blood.
