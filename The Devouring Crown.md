Consists of 2 creatures, bound in 1, but separatable 

[[King Avaric the Gilded]]
and
[[The Pale Regent]]

## Core Theme
Consumption without limit.

Life reduced to resource.
Forest reduced to fuel.
Balance reduced to caloric value.

## Faction Head
[[King Avaric the Gilded]]

Publicly:
- Expansionist monarch
- Heavy taxation
- Aggressive logging and mining
- Confiscation of magical relics
- Hoarding of wealth and artifacts

Secretly:
Host to [[The Pale Regent]].

---

## The Pale Regent

A sentient parasitic entity bonded to the king.

### Nature
- Motivated purely by survival
- Consumes matter of any type
- Converts consumed matter into vitality
- Preserves host longevity

It does not crave power.
It craves continuation.

### Effects on the Kingdom
- Tax revenue literally consumed
- Sacred relics dissolved
- Confiscated grain vanished
- Forests burned and fed to royal furnaces

Rumors persist of:
- Acid-scarred vault floors
- Empty treasury chambers
- Ash instead of gold

## Signature Ability Concept

### Adaptive Consumption (Recharge 5–6)
If [[King Avaric the Gilded]] consumes a significant elemental or magical source:

- Gains Resistance 10 to that damage type for 3 rounds
- Physical matter may grant minor DR/–
- Magical scrolls may temporarily increase Spell Resistance

Visual Manifestation:
- Veins glow with consumed element
- Skin texture subtly alters
- Voice harmonizes with devoured energy

## Notable Generals

### [[Garruk Splinteraxe]]
- Barbarian
- Dual-wielding axes
- Obsessed with felling trees
- Would destroy forests even unpaid
- Officially sanctioned “Resource Acquisition Commander”

Motivation: Destruction as joy.

---

## Philosophical Opposition to [[Druidic Circles]]
- Nature as food source only
- Stewardship viewed as inefficiency
- Growth must justify existence

---

## Relationship to Other Factions
- Sees [[The Iron Concordance]] as useful stabilizers
- Distrusts [[The Shattered Hour]] (time distortions disrupt feeding patterns)
- The Pale Regent cannot feed in temporal stasis zones

---

## Campaign Seeds
- Logging camp encroaching on [[Evershade Forest]]
- Missing tax shipment
- Caravan of confiscated relics
- Forest animals fleeing from clear-cutting
